# Demo_OrangeHRM

 Here, I wrote the Test script(demo_orange_hrm.java) for a particular end-to-end scenario for the Demo orange HRM website (https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login) using the framework I
 know such as POM(Page Object Model), testNG. 
 
 Base_class.java consists of all the statements that are used to open the application, close the application, maximize the browser, pass the URL, etc using the respective Annotations such as @AfterMethod and 
 @BeforeMethod.
